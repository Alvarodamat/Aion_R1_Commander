Hello world! I'm √Ålvaro, welcome to my Aion R1 Commander repository!

This package and all the documentation is part of my degree's final project used to complete my formation. Please, use it as a start-up-guide
to set a communication between ArduPilot and a companion computer in your robot. I hope this, my very first big project, will be useful for you
to achieve your project goals!
